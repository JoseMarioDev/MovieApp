### Github workflow

- developer works locally in feature branch
- working with three environments: development, staging, production. Each environment will have it's own S3 bucket
- once feature is complete, dev merges into dev branch (dev environment)
- once feature is working as required, merge dev branch -> staging branch (staging environment)
- can merge from staging -> master branch (prod environment)
